        <div class="plot-content"> During a massive dust storm, Joseph Cooper and his daughter Murphy find an encoded message in a pattern of dust on Murphy’s bedroom floor. Cooper deduces that it’s caused by a gravitational anomaly, and decodes the message to find coordinates to NASA’s secret base.

          Upon arriving at the base, they are apprehended by Dr. John Brand’s team. Brand reveals NASA’s plan to save humanity from famine caused by climate change by leaving Earth to find a new home. Additionally, Brand explains they plan to use a wormhole (theorized to have been created by more advanced, intelligent beings) to explore a distant star system of planets orbiting a massive black hole. Since Cooper is a former pilot, Brand invites him to pilot the spacecraft that they will use to travel through this wormhole.

        </div>
        <div class="plot-content"> NASA's "Plan A" is to follow to find an exoplanet capable of supporting life, so that humanity can be moved off Earth in a mass exodus (made possible by Brand's yet-to-be-solved gravity equation). Failing this, "Plan B" is to use embryos to seed an extra-terrestrial colony on the new planet while letting Earth's original population perish. Brand invites Cooper to pilot the mission. Believing that Plan A can save Murph's generation, Cooper agrees. He pilots the spacecraft Endurance, transporting a crew of three scientists: Romilly, Doyle, and Brand’s daughter Amelia, and two robot assistants TARS and CASE, to the other galaxy. Arriving in the other galaxy, the crew follow up on initial investigations of three planets, each orbiting the supermassive black hole Gargantua. The first planet, an ocean world of shallow water assigned to explorer Laura Miller, turns out to have colossal tidal waves generated by Gargantua's gravity. Laura is presumed killed after the crew find debris at her beacon's location. Doyle is swept away by a huge wave, and Cooper and Amelia narrowly escape the next. They return to the Endurance, where Romilly has been studying the blackhole while in orbit. Though only a couple of hours in their perspective, 23 years have passed aboard Endurance and on Earth due to the time dilation caused by Gargantua's gravity. Back on Earth, Murph has become a scientist working with NASA. Info from: https:/ /en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Interstellar_(film) </div>

            Climax
          </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="plot-content"> A dying Brand confesses to Murph that Plan A is unviable as the gravity-equation cannot be solved without data obtainable only inside a black hole. He predicts that Earth's humanity is doomed to perish. Murph assumes this to mean that her father knowingly abandoned her, but continues Brand's work nonetheless. Looking for clues, she visits her childhood bedroom as the original source of the gravitational anomaly.

          In the other galaxy, the mission to the second planet fails when Cooper learns that the planet's explorer, Mann, lied about the ice planet's habitability. Determined to save himself, Mann attempts to kill the crew while setting off with a Ranger craft to hijack the Endurance. Romilly is killed at the base, but Cooper and Amelia survive and escape in a Lander craft, before regaining control of the Endurance when Mann is killed by a failed docking procedure. Devising a plan to reach the third and final planet, Cooper initiates a slingshot maneuver around Gargantua to propel the Endurance with limited fuel. He sacrifices himself and TARS to shed extra weight, allowing Amelia to safely reach the planet previously investigated by Wolfe Edmunds.
          
          TARS and Cooper are sucked into the blackhole, encountering a four-dimensional tesseract where time is physically presented. Seeing past moments from Murph's bedroom, Cooper tries to contact her by manipulating items in the room with gravity. He deduces he was the source of the initial anomaly in Murph's room that led to this mission, and concludes that he was brought to this tesseract by future humans – "them" – for him to send information to Murph in the past. With TARS's help, he relays the data Murph needs to solve the gravity equation. The tesseract closes, ejecting Cooper and TARS into Saturn's orbit.
