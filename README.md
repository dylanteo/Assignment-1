# Website on Interstellar

I want to create a website about interstellar which includes plot, cast and how they created the incredible cinematics in the movie and the background of the movie.
## Design Process

I wanted to create a visually appealing website that gives the overview of the movie Interstellar. I looked through the colour scheme of gargantua, the black hole in interstellar and used that as my main colour scheme. I decided on 4 pages, which is home page, about, cast, and plot. This website is for people who have yet to know about the movie Interstellar before and its their first time seing it. If I was a user who has never seen Interstellar before, I would want to know the cast, to see if there are any actors I like and to see the plot to see if I will be interested about the story.
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

## Features

I have 4 pages, Home, About, Cast and Plot. In my cast page on mobile, I have added a drop down menu for some parts of the text. In Cast and Plot, I have added sliders to turn the different groups or sections in each page.
 
### Existing Features
- Dropdown - allows users to make text dropdown, by pressing the bolded text
- Sliders - allows users to turn to different sections, by pressing the left and right arrow buttons

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

On computer screens, my about page's text are fully laid out, on mobile however, only the first paragraph is shown, and the other 2 parts are opened using dropdown. On the cast page, on computer screens, the 3 cast members in each group are laid out in a row, which allows the user to see all 3 at once, however, on mobile it is in columns, where users scroll down to see the different casts. On my plot page, the videos sizes had to be lowered on smaller screens as the screens were smaller than the videos size itself

An interesting bug i found was in javascript, even thought i have defined var indexValue as 1, it continued to stayed as either undefined or Nan, i solved this by defining it again in my function
